            Steps
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season both sides of shrimp with garlic powder and salt, and set aside.</li>

            <li>Combine gochujang, honey, sesame oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic, and ginger in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Heat oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 2 to 3 minutes, flipping half way through; do not overcook. Remove shrimp from the pan.</li>

            <li>Reduce temperature to low, and add sauce to skillet. Whisk water and cornstarch together in a small bowl to make a slurry. Stir slurry into the sauce until well combined. Keep cooking, stirring constantly, until the sauce starts to slightly thicken, about 1 minute. Add shrimp back into the skillet and stir until coated and just heated through.</li>

            <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and scallions. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
